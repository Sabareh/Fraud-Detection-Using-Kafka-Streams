# Fraud Detection from IP Logs using Kafka Streams

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Apache Kafka Streams to detect fraudulent activities by analyzing IP logs in real-time. By processing the streaming data, the system flags potential fraud by identifying suspicious patterns, such as repeated login attempts or access from unusual IP addresses. Kafka Streams offers a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for processing large-scale log data, making it ideal for real-time fraud detection.

## Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Streams IP logs continuously from Kafka topics for real-time detection.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies and flags suspicious activities based on predefined rules and patterns.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Leverages Kafka Streams for horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Customizable Rules**: Allows for configurable fraud detection rules to adjust sensitivity.

## Technologies Used

- **Kafka Streams**: Core for stream processing.
- **Apache Kafka**: Message broker for distributing IP log data.
- **Java/Scala**: Programming language used for building Kafka Streams application.
- **Zookeeper**: Manages Kafka cluster and configuration.
- **Docker (Optional)**: For containerized deployment of Kafka and Zookeeper.
- **Prometheus & Grafana (Optional)**: For monitoring and visualizing Kafka metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Apache Kafka installed locally or available via a cluster (or Docker setup).
- Java 8+ installed.
- Zookeeper installed (if running Kafka locally).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sabareh/fraud-detection-using-kafka-streams.git
   cd fraud-detection-using-kafka-streams
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Start Kafka and Zookeeper**:
   
   If using Docker, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   Alternatively, start Kafka and Zookeeper manually.

4. **Configure Kafka Topics**:

   Create the necessary topics for streaming logs and fraud detection alerts.

   ```bash
   kafka-topics.sh --create --topic ip-logs --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
   kafka-topics.sh --create --topic fraud-alerts --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

6. **Send IP Logs to Kafka**:

   You can simulate IP log data by producing messages to the `ip-logs` topic. For example:

   ```bash
   kafka-console-producer.sh --topic ip-logs --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
   ```

   Send some test log data to see how the system reacts.

### Customizing Fraud Detection Rules

Modify the `CacheIPLookup.java` to adjust the detection logic. For example, you can change the rule that flags IPs with more than X failed logins within Y minutes or alerts on access from specific geo-locations.

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java**: Contains the Kafka Streams application and logic for fraud detection.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Optional Docker configuration for running Kafka and Zookeeper locally.
- **prometheus.yml**: (Optional) Configuration file for setting up Prometheus for monitoring.

## Example Use Case

Imagine monitoring login activity for an online banking system. The fraud detection system identifies abnormal login patterns, such as multiple failed attempts from a single IP or login attempts from IP addresses associated with known proxies or malicious sources.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced fraud detection using machine learning models.
- Integration with other real-time alerting services like Slack or email.
- Store detected fraud events in a database for audit purposes.
- Support for geo-fencing by integrating with a geo-location API.
